Melody Generation using LSTM
Project Overview
This project focuses on generating musical melodies using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model is trained on a dataset of melodies to learn sequences and generate new melodies based on the learned patterns.

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of melodies. The dataset should be placed in the dataset/ directory. It consists of MIDI files, and a mapping.json file is used to map notes to numerical representations for training.

Model Architecture
The model uses a sequential LSTM network designed to handle musical sequences. The key layers of the architecture are:

LSTM layers for sequence processing.
Dense layers for generating the next note in the sequence.
Model summary:

python
Copy code
- Input Layer: LSTM with (sequence_length, 1) input shape
- Hidden Layers: 2 LSTM layers with 128 units
- Output Layer: Dense layer with softmax activation for generating note probabilities
Training
Preprocess the dataset by running:

bash
Copy code
python preprocessing.py
Train the LSTM model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Training configurations:

Batch size: 64
Epochs: 100
Optimizer: Adam
The trained model will be saved as model.h5 in the project directory.

Usage
To generate a melody using the trained model:

Run the melody generation script:

bash
Copy code
python melody_generator.py
The generated melody will be saved in the Output/ folder as a MIDI file.

You can adjust parameters, such as the sequence length and temperature, in the melody_generator.py file.

Results
After training the model, the generated melodies will be stored in the Output/ folder. Each melody is saved as a MIDI file, which can be played using any MIDI player.
